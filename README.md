This is a simple bash script that serves as a tutorial for bash commands. It operates under the assumption that you are using a Linux-based operating system.

## Installation

2. On the command line, enter `cd Desktop` to move to your Desktop directory. (You can skip this step if you don't want this repository to be on your Desktop.)
